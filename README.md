# Graviton

Welcome to the Graviton repository! You can browse the source code, or visit our [wiki](https://github.com/cps-209-team-3/Graviton/wiki).
### Instructions
Use the W, A, S, and D keys to move the ship. If it doesn't seem to want to comply, don't fret, that's just gravity. Fly over the small colored orbs to pick them up and then fly over the larger circles (gravity wells) to deposit the orbs inside. The orb's color must correspond to that of the gravity well, or else nothing will happen.
